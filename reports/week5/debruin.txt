Elliott de BruinCSE 403Team: FlintWeek 5 Individual Status ReportProgress Report:	This week we got a lot of work done as a team. We decided that we will creating Flint as plugin for Intellij IDEA. We came up with a concrete architecture layout for our software as well as an implementation plan for it. For my part this week I am working on the compile checker for the driver. So far this week, I have been able to write a small test program in which I am able to compile another java file by running my test program, with it printing “Successfully compiled” if the given file compiles or “Failed to compile” if the file does not compile. Now I need to implement this in our driver file. This should not take too long so I will be able to help with other people’s parts of the CLI tool once I am done. I also created our project directory with Gradle for our build system and pushed it to our GitHub repository. At this point I have not run into any problems, but we are also not very far into our implementation yet.Plans and Goals for the Week:* Write up clean specifications for all components we are building this week* Revise our proposal from last week* Write the user manual for Flinto Needs to have a very detailed guide on all the ways the user will be allowed to configure their style check file* Build the driver for Flinto I am responsible for the compile checker* Build the CLI adapter * Build the configuration component * Have a working CLI version of Flint by the end of the week
