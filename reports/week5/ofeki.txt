Goals from last week:
  * Decide on an IDE to develop for
  * Write up Architecture and Implementation Plan
  * Produce specifications and User Manual

Progress over the week:
  * Decided on IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE to develop for
  * Designed (and wrote up) Architecture and Implementation Plan
  * Designated responsibilities for development and testing the components of the
      architecture
  * I am responsible for developing the Syntax-Parsing functionality of the Driver
      (and its interactions with the Configuration), and testing the CLI (and, possibly,
      IDE) Adapter
  * Wrote specifications for all the components
  * Decided to push back writing the User Manual until after we knew what we want
      users to test

Goals for next week:
  * Finish developing all assigned components
  * Finish testing all assigned components
  * Write up User Manual
  * Have a working prototype by start of next week
