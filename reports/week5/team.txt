Agenda for Weekly Meeting:
* Questions for Manager:
   * Are we on track to finish the product in time?
   * Should we be prioritizing anything over “user-testing early”?
* Questions for Customer:
   * What is the hardest part of learning to use a new tool?
   * What are the most important parts to learn in order to be able to use the tool? What is supplementary or unnecessary?
   * At this point in development, would you be inclined to use our tool over others? Why/why not?
