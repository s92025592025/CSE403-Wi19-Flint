Goal: 
	Research IDE plugin/extension development (decide on an IDE to develop for)
	Design architecture & implementation plan (produce deliverables)
	Write up specifications & user manual

Progress:
	We have now descided on using IntellJ as the final platform for us to implement out final product. We have also descided on the architecture and who is responsiable for which part of it. I should be responsable for the CLI adapter. The specification should be almost done, except for a few places that connects the different parts of the architecture still needs to sort out the details. I remember we eventually descided that the user manual should be out before the user testing instead of now since we still not have a concrete idea of what we want the user to look for in user testing.

Next Goal:
	Build and Test CLI.
